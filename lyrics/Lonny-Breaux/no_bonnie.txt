I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie I'm sorry so sorry

I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her

No Bonnie

The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby
My Bonnie, My Bonnie

No Bonnie
No Bonnie, I'm sorry
So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie
