I just wanna make love
Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
Imma hit a few keys bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now (ow)
Fix you up another Mai Thai (Thai)
No sun on the horizon (on)
Let's make a song for the night time (time)

I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

Stroke of harmony kiss you on your neck
I'm changin up your voice sound (changin up your sound)
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
and make you climax now (ahh ahh)
Now we switching up the melody (ay!)
We take it down to a minor stage (stage)
We making noise like we can't believe (ay)
Let's put this moment on replay

Oooooh
Girl what'cha you wanna - dooo
Back it up, back it up, back it up up up
I think I got a cluuue
Girl whatcha you wanna doooooo
You wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
