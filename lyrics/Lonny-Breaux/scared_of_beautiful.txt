Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful thighs

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
