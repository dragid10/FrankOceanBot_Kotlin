If I had 20 million dollars in the vault somewhere baby
It wouldn't matter anyway, yeah
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby

Did you know ?

News said that the sky is fallin'
The globe is warmin'
My country's warin'
The leaders a liar
Time is runnin'
Lower and lower babe lower babe
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end
End baby, quickly

Told me I don't even know your name
I said well then we mine as well make ours the same
What you think baby. (No time)
Vegas might as well be light years away
So we better lay under the stars
Before they crashin' down

That's right baby kiss me like the world is wicked
Like the Earth is shakin'
You got it baby
That's right love me
Feel me like our time is sprinting faster
Running out on us

I know we just met but baby could you love me quickly, quickly
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end
Baby, quickly, yeahh
Barely know me baby
But you gotta love me quickly, quickly
Ohhh
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end baby
Quickly
Gotta love me baby, quick now
Gotta love me baby, quickly now
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end baby, quickly

Lou said the sky was fallin, yeah
Lou said. Ohh na naaa
