Okay, thought about it for a minute
Can't let love go spinnin' down the drain now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
Simple math, pen & pad; gotta work out

You're my homie, baby you're my homie
But you're my only, baby you're my only
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out
It can't be hard

Gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no
Been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wrackin' my brain
No love still
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
No love still
No love

Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie

You're my homie, baby you're my only
She's the past, She's my future, my right now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out boy
I know it's hard

Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work
Can't use an elevator, to get back up to you
Never had a clue
