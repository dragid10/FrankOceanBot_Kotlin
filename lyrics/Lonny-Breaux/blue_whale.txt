Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My so glow with the low cut
No jheri curl, jerry rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, don’t think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin me
Swearin’ he’s grown and he’s got that skill
But he ain’t swim with that blue whale
I ain’t swim with that hoe neither
Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water
Hope the monster don’t wag his tale
And send that big wave over while
I’m showin off my pirate girl
To the baddies walkin by me

Showin skin because its nothing
My little brother servin’ molly
Because that bill due Monday
And my passports buried
And my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water
But my shoes still muddy

And if I ever have a daughter
I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach
I guess I call her karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat
I’m kidding but I’m ballin’
Just playin’ but I’m serious
I’m wit it and I’m wildin

This life goes on man that’s one thing about it
This life goes on dawg that's one thing about it
I’m feelin’ what your sayin’, you’re trying to get around it
But life goes on pimpin, the wise don’t doubt it

Stuck in the sky, first time upside down, on the whole ride
And I wasn’t much into the type, that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that’s alright
Black women ain’t got no man
That’s what she said to me, yeah she did
But she can date outside your race, I mean
I ain’t supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case I mean
Somebody please switch my plates
Ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain’t ridin chrome
Back pack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let a relevant nigga do, what a relevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge, because his gavel fake and he regular still
How that gravel taste? how you paid your medical bills?
Sands white on my tan feet
Coliseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your mac sleep
Relaxing
I ain’t racing no fuckin’ rats
I'm relaxing
And if its wrong to yah

Well life goes on brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on my nigga one thing about it
I’m sayin’ what you’re seein’, we trying to talk around it
But life goes on pimpin, the wise done doubt it
