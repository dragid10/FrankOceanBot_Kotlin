Arm stretch the tee like I nailed it
Wrapped it in slow like a creed
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Prefer like some Gucci sandals
Hopin' this guy got an anvil
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you can handle
Gave you what you can handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
AD's got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'... Got

Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four will excitin' us more
I'm cold where the temperatures dip below 17
How can I be burr around, are they close?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany broach
On my lapelle, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do
Maybe the feeling just comes in and goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can do on our own
I landed a trick on my impossible
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours a day, never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage, I'm bikin'
