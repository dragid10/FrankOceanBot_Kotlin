Get on my bike and ima fly through time
Until I'm with you.. I promise

I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And thats cost you years

This is has been one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears
So time machine take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her with her with her can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her with her with ain't living by herself
Lift off an goooo Oooooh Ooooooh

I tried
With all my might I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker
Our life all this
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there we're making out listening to pruple rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

This is has been one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears
So time machine take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her with her with her can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her with her with ain't living by herself
Lift off an goooo Oooooh Ooooooh

I'm on my way their
To that time and place
Wish you could see all that I see now
I'm headed toward you
I'm wishin' time could wait
I'm a mile away

So time machine take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her with her with her can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her with her with ain't living by herself
Lift off an goooo Oooooh Ooooooh
