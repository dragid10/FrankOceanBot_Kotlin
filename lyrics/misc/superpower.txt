(Super power)
A subtle power
(Super power)
A tough love
(Super power)
Uh huh, like a shark
(Super power)
Ooh, Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve, without us
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down
