Sterling silver lasers
Rubies red, my skin too black to blush
This bitch to ret to bust
Seen it on the iPhone pages
This ain't on the Gram, Wizard of Oz
Parka pockets full of mint leaves
Guap smelling like it brush teeth
Say cheese, see the porcelain
Xans and water, see swordfish
Backwoods all forestry
Raf draggin' off the floor, bitch
Flame thrower in it
I'm torchin' the road in these Gucci flames
Stuck to the pavement, they glued
I'm 2.5 million a venue
And 2500 a tooth
I'm coatin' my lungs in the muddy
I'm cold like I'm sick with the flu
I covered my face and I'm bloody
That's Spring/Summer 2002
Two, two, two, two, yeah
Please don't touch my Raf
Sleep Pendergrass, Teddy
Sleep with the Teddy
Quick with the hands, ready
Please don't touch my bag
Please don't touch my Raf
Shirt off, I'm cam ready
Deadstock in memory
Please don't pop my tag
