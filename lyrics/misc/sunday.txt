I’m coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I’ll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
And you parade my homecoming, don’t cry
You know I can’t live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I’d be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly please, palm, no marijuana trees
Yo hickeys on my aorta and tattoos you could only see
When I’m playing surfboarder, put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you think’s cool
They thought me soft in High School, thank God I’m jagged
Forgot you don’t like it rough, I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon' be when I’m aiming my gun
And why’s his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?
Standing ovation at Staples I got my Grammy’s and gold
Polka dots on my brit, I’m not supposed to be stunting
It’s all melodic this song, I catch this vibe in my sleep
But I’m just jet-lagged is all, and restless

All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you’s a little different I don’t like you a lot
I mean…fuck
