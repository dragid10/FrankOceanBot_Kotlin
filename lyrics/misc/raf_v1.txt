We gon' need a bigger table though
Need some cable, tired of watchin' basic
Wouldn't sign ya if I had a label
That designer on a nigga label fuego
Down the bottle, still under the limit
I could buy your bitch just off my debit
I could buy her, not fuck up my credit
Ain't no executives flexin' my blessings
Ain't no middleman cut in my blessings
I got all of this flick for the Lord's worship
You ain't slammin', got the Asperger's
I'ma drag that nigga, he deserve it
I'ma read his ass like a Labeija
Anna Wintour cool with my mama
And it's winter fool, need a bomber
Plate of ravioli at Obama's right right right
(Can't you see I'm eating what's poppin?)
Mix the ravioli, stuffed with diamonds, right, right?
(We don't have the same problems)
I get Raf Simons 'cause I'm gifted
That means sometimes I get it and don't even want
Give Raf Simons when I'm giftin'
That means sometimes I give it, you know that you want it
